   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to MatchMaker's documentation!
======================================

``matchmaker`` makes it easy to write hamcrest matchers with minimum coding.

It includes decorators that turn simple functions into hamcrest matchers.  
The only requirement for these functions is that they must return boolean values,
and they can optionally include a docstring that will be used as a descriptive
text when matching fails.

The sources can be found in GitHub_.
